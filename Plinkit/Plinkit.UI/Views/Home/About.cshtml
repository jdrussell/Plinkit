        pLinkIt was thrown together by Jonathan Russell, a .net developer, based in Stirling Scotland. I have worked 
        commercially with .net and the Microsoft Technology stack since 2003 in the areas of Document Management, 
        Ticketing, and Actuarial Modelling. A self-confessed geek, I am inspired by guys like Uncle Bob Martin, 
        Martin Fowler and Michael Feathers, Steve McConnell, SOLID principles, Clean Code and the pursuit of doing things 'right'.

        Being a developer demands that you stay abreast of current trends, practices, technologies and tools. 
        By compiling this list of daily links to blogs and resources, I am attempting to ease that process. I hope you
        find it useful too.

        When not coding, I'm spending time with my family, playing with my sons David and Michael; watching football,
        attempting to play football, thinking about football... and when the boys allow it, I also get to sometimes enjoy
        sleeping (albeit infrequently)
